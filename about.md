# Sign Language at Scale: About Robotica

Our AI solutions tackle the inequalities faced by deaf and partially hearing people by positively impacting the means to access to spoken and written language.

By measurably transforming people’s ability to understand and be understood, our work promotes inclusivity, social mobility and quality of life.

We are based out of Norwich in the heart of Norfolk, UK.

## Humans are Best

At the heart of everything we do is the unshakeable belief that humans are best: no matter how incredible AI may be, it isn't a substitute for a person.  The warmth, empathy and trust of interacting with a human being is irreplaceable.  With that in mind, we always encourage use of Deaf translators or RSLI interpreters as the default choice:  Nobody wants a computer explaining a court ruling or giving them a medical diagnosis.

## Competing with Captions, not with Translators

There simply are too few translators and interpreters, nowhere near the numbers needed to keep up with the accellerating rate of content creation.  Every single minute of every day, 8 new books are published.  In that time, 500 hours of videos are uploaded to YouTube, and 175 new websites are made - an average of 2,000 pages per minute.  With 1,000 times as many translators, people who rely on sign languages would still be denied almost all of the information and entertainment that most of us take for granted.

We fill in the gaps, where translators are available, or aren’t the best fit.  We make sign language translations that would not otherwise get made.
