# A fine idea in a fine city
Robotica Machine Learning is a small software development consultancy based out of Norwich in the heart of Norfolk, UK.  Robotica was founded by [Adrian Pickering](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrianpickering/){:target="_blank"} for the purpose of bringing advances from the relatively mature world of computer science to the brave new world of data science.  We have the core aim of making the act of out-sourcing software development projects transparent, honest and straightforward.


## Straightforward how?
It's all about respect.

Any consultancy will insist that they are customer focussed, but do they really put you at the centre of every decision?  How might that manifest?  With every interaction, we pursue a win-win outcome. We operate on the footing of scheduled, measurable customer success criteria - agreeing outcomes in advance.  Take a look at our cookie policy for a tiny example of our slightly different way of thinking:
>We respect you, we donâ€™t track you. There are no cookies.


We don't sell to you, we partner with you. This means that the each process is bespoke; as much yours as it is ours. We work together on shared milestones and objectives.  The work we undertake is priced according to agreed value.  We have no incentive to cut corners or to tring out time and materials billing. And if we make a mistake, we will come clean immediately and find a mutual way forward to make good.  We recognise that needs change as part of our commitment.

** Working with Robotica is designed to be the easiest choice you will make and one you will not regret. **



## What's wrong with data science?
Data science is an exciting field and it is not hyperbole to say that the outputs are fundamentally transforming the way business operates. Far beyond robotic process automation, predictive AI empowers organisations to automate a broad range of analyses - [from inventory management to fraud analysis to custom pricing](/posts/opportunities).  At a very high level, the workflow for this involves problem discovery and analysis, gathering and shaping data, designing and crafting computational models, putting them into production and using them.  This really is not so far removed from the way computer software projects have historically been managed.  Data science programmes are now fighting the same battles which are only now being won in computer science: over-running projects that don't keep up with requirements and are seldom deployed to be exploited by end users.

Over the last twenty years, the rise of agile methodologies for frequent, iterative delivery of working product, has emerged to empower organisations and delivered ongoing value against an ever-changing landscape. The cycle time for turning ideas into software in the hands of users has been reduced from months or years to days or hours.  Automated testing and deployment makes this possible.  Robotica Machine Learning extends these processes into tooling to bring comparable benefits to automate machine learning.  We have concentrated our efforts on understanding the [reasons why many data science programmes end in the lab](/posts/reasons-why-many-data-science-programmes-end-in-the-lab) and engineering robust solutions to the underlying causes.


## DataRobot and Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services
Gartner recognises DataRobot and Microsoft as visionaries in the [Magic Quadrant for Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms](https://blog.datarobot.com/datarobot-included-for-the-first-time-as-a-visionary-in-the-2019-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-platforms){:target="_blank"}.  We are proud partners, integrating these best-of-breed stacks directly into your systems and processes, extending their benefits with continuous integration, continuous delivery and human-readable, automated governance rules and fitness functions.  We believe that nobody offers a more complete picture, helping you to realise your machine learning ambitions quickly, robustly and with longevity.


## What is automated machine learning?
Automated machine learning has become a loaded term. Drag-and-drop applications offer improved user experience but demand substantial commitment, technical understanding and effort from data scientists and engineers.  Our fully automated machine learning pipelines continue to learn and deploy, growing and improving alongside your data.  We go further: rather than retraining models on new data, we automate complete redesigns of new models, unassisted, explained and governed to meet your compliance demands.  Bespoke software is an investment and it should offer compound value.
