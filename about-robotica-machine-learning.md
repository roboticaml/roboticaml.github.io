# A fine idea in a fine city
Robotica Machine Learning is a small software development consultancy based out of Norwich in the heart of Norfolk, UK.  Founded by [Adrian Pickering](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrianpickering/){:target="_blank"} for the purpose of bringing advances made in software development to the world of data science and with the aim of making the process of out-sourcing software development projects transparent, honest and straightforward.

## Straightforward how?
It all boils down to respect.

Every consultancy will tell you they are customer focussed, but do they really mean it?  How does it manifest?  With each interaction, we aim for a win-win outcome. We operate on the basis of scheduled, measurable customer success criteria and agreeing outcomes in advance.  Take a look at our cookie policy for a tiny example of our slightly different way of thinking:
>We respect you, we donâ€™t track you. There are no cookies.

We don't sell to you, wel sell with you. This means that the sales process, is as much yours as ours, with shared milestones and objectives.  The work we undertake is costed according to agreed value, so we have no incentive to cut corners or string out time and materials. And when we make mistakes, we come clean immediately and seek agreement on how to make good.  Working with Robotica Machine Learning is designed to be the easiest choice you will make and one you will not regret.


## What's wrong with data science?
Data science is an exciting field and it is not hyperbole to say that the outputs are fundamentally transforming the way business operates. Far beyond robotic process automation, predictive AI empowers organisations to automate a broad range of analyses - from inventory management to fraud analysis to custom pricing.  At a very high level, the workflow for this involves problem discovery and analysis, gathering and shaping data, designing and crafting computational models to solve the problem, putting them live and then using them.  This really is not so far removed from the way computer software projects have historically been managed, and now data science programmes face the analogous issues: over-running projects that don't meet the requirements and are seldom deployed to be exploited by end users.

Over the last twenty years, the rise of agile methodologies for frequent, iterative delivery of working product, has empowered businesses and delivered ongoing value against an ever-changing landscape. The cycle time for ideas to be implemented as software in the hands of users has been reduced from months or years to days or hours.  Automated testing and deployment makes this possible.  Robotica Machine Learning extends these processes into tooling to bring comparable benefits to automate machine learning.


## What is automated machine learning?
Automated machine learning has become a bit of a loaded term. Drag-and-drop applications, easing steps but demanding just as much technical understanding.  Our solutions continue to learn and deploy, growing and improving alongside your data.  This, whilst unusual, is not totally unique.  Where we go a step further is that many of our solutions can not just retrain models but can completely redesign new models, unassisted, but governed by your processes.  Bespoke software is an investment and it should offer compound value.
