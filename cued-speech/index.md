Cued speech helps deaf people see what you’re saying.

It’s a manual system of 8 handshapes in 4 positions near the mouth which completely clarify the lip-patterns of your speech and it is quick and comparatively easy to learn.

It turns your spoken language (English and many other languages) into a visual language. Research shows that with Cued Speech 96% of English can be accurately lip-read. You can help your deaf baby or child see the whole of the English language as clearly as hearing people can hear it.

> “Because there’s no new language to learn – just a simple system we could use Cued Speech straight away and say anything”


Robotica has a long-standing partnership with the [Cued Speech UK](https://www.cuedspeech.co.uk/#){:target="_blank"} charity to deliver digital communications assistants to facilitate effective communication between speaking and non-hearing people in the workplace, in education settings and at home. Cued Speech UK also provides Robotica with significant consultancy services including subject matter expertise, marketing & market research, focus groups and analysis.

## Cued Speech, enabled by Cassie, improves literacy in deaf and hearing people, and people with learning disabilities

Cassie on phones/computers and as virtual attendees in conference calls facilitates inclusivity, productivity, opportunity. Our technologies reduce the need for support workers and help to close the earnings gap between deaf and hearing people. These technologies are helping to extend conventional education to deaf children so fewer fall behind or need significant classroom support, aiding career prospects.

Cassie listens as people speak and repeats it back clearly, in a neutral accent. Her words are echoed as on-screen captions, realistic mouth shapes for lip-readers and as Cued Speech signs.

The artificial intelligence technology that powers Cassie, invented by Robotica, is being used throughout society to extend written and spoken language to deaf people as visual communication. She signs television programming, interprets in video conferencing calls and helps partially hearing children in schools gain access to full, mainstream education.

Cued Speech is accurately performed, in real-time, by Cassie and AVComprehend, and is deployed into real-world environments. As a fully automated system, new markets can be explored rapidly as only the connectivity needs to be created for each experiment.

The solution is highly scalable, with AVComprehend running in the cloud and Cassie requiring only minimal computing power on users’ device. Even low-range smartphones and tablets competently perform Cued Speech on demand.

We have also co-developed the uCue educational game to teach Cued Speech signing with Cued Speech UK.
