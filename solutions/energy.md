# AI and the Energy Sector

Commodity cycles, capital planning and forecasting challenges, and increasing operational and maintenance risks in the Energy industry are all factors that make it more important than ever to make smarter and more efficient decisions.

# ML Ops & Maintenance

With the dynamic landscape for energy production, AI provides powerful benefits across the entire value chain. AI helps oil and gas companies assess the value of specific reservoirs, customize drilling and completion plans according to the geology of the area, and assess risks of each well.

Machine Learning can model normal wind and water turbine behaviour, detect yaw misalignment, pitch-bearing, generator stator insulation, and transformer failure prediction, and detect poor bearing lubrication and bearing wear.

In addition, downstream operations can be optimized to minimize costs and maximize spreads.

# Forecasting

Machine Learning models can forecast both Electric Power Load (EPLF) demand and electric power generation. Deregulation of energy markets means that finding a demand forecasting model for specific electricity network is not an easy task. It is, however, one to which Robotica's strategic partnership with Allotrope is uniquely suited to solve. Robotica's Energy AI extensions to the Allotrope platform provides a simple toolset for both generation and demand forecasting which is tailored to your organisation. Furthermore, DataRobot allows the model to be continuously and automatically tweaked, tuned, and redeployed as new data arrives.

# AI and the Smart Grid

Distribution Network Operators are facing unprecedented challenges in keeping the lights on whilst margins shrink, capacity shortages loom and peaks and troughs in energy supply become ever more unpredictable.

Our partnership with Allotrope provides the ability for Operators to connect islands of centralised IT systems and sensors into clouds of data that enables machine learning and intelligent automation across hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of data points, where connectivity, sensing and automation is ubiquitous and pervasive throughout every element of the grid.  In turn, this allows the Distribution Network Operators and their partners to massively orchestrate both production-side and demand-side capacity, to create a smart grid that is cleaner, cheaper, more secure, more efficient, and more predictable.

# Conclusion

With Robotica Enterprise AI and our partnerships with DataRobot and Allotrope, Energy companies can increase revenue, deliver the returns investors require, improve return on assets, and manage downside risks by turning much of the data already collected into usable and valuable insight - making decisions more effectively and more efficiently.
