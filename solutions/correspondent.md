Seamlessly accessible, QR codes require no additional app downloads or special permissions. All you need to do is point your camera, and the engaging content is instantly delivered.

## What’s wrong with written words?

Individuals who are born and raised without hearing develop the ability to communicate using gestures, facial expressions, and body language. For them, a visual language like British Sign Language often serves as their primary or exclusive means of communication, becoming the language of their inner thoughts. In such cases, traditional written and spoken words might offer limited assistance, if any.
Experience heightened engagement, gain the ability to make confident decisions, and foster inclusivity with Gazette.

## Create an inclusive environment

Our platform supports your ambition to create a fully inclusive environment, where deaf individuals, visitors with visual impairments, and those with reading difficulties feel welcomed and engaged at your venue.


## Translations directly on customers’ phones

There are numerous reasons why individuals might require information accessible on their phones, catering to various needs:

* Sign Language users, whose reading ability may be limited or non-existent due to English not being their primary language.
* Children and adults who are still in the process of learning to read.
* Visitors who do not speak English as their first language.
* Individuals with dyslexia or learning difficulties that impact their reading capabilities.
* People with impaired vision, who depend on large text and screen readers for accessibility.

Gazette presents a multitude of advantages for both you and your valued customers.
The platform ensures inclusivity and equal access for Sign Language users and non-English speakers, fostering a welcoming environment for all.
By enhancing the depth of engagement, Gazette contributes to generating positive reviews and word-of-mouth recommendations.
Additionally, targeted promotions and relevant materials can be seamlessly offered to your audience.
Gazette goes a step further by anonymously recording key engagement data, subjecting it to analysis, and converting it into actionable insights. These quantitative and objective measures determine both individual and group patterns of visitor behaviour, providing valuable information for decision-making.
