# Supporting Agriculture with Predictive Analytics
>![Harvesting](/images/harvesting.png)
Farmers strive to optimise land use to feed a growing world population.  Accommodating such growth requires innovative methods to produce quality food with high yields in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner. 

Agriculture has lead every industrial revolution, and the range of tools created for and by farming is extensive:  robotics, drones, Internet of Things (IoT), computer vision and machine learning all advance farming success.  Driverless vehicle systems, such as [iTec Pro](https://www.deere.com/en/technology-products/precision-ag-technology/guidance/itec-pro/){:target="_blank"} have been improving productivity and consistency long before the first road cars started to gain semi-autonomous capabilities.

High tech Smart Farming is a powerful force in delivering profitability to farmers.  Artificial intelligence is unique in often delivering strong Return on Investment (ROI) rapidly.

### Irrigation Management and Moisture Monitoring
>![Irrigation Management](/images/irrigation-management.png)
Good irrigation has been a central feature in farming for thousands of years.  Ultra-localised management of sprinkler and drainage systems, with discrete control of timing and flow, can reduce the amount of wasted water, deliver more flexibility in operations and produce a higher yield of crops.

### Pest Tracking and Prediction
>![Pest Tracking](/images/pest-tracking.png)
Crop-destroying pests can wipe out entire seasons' efforts and earnings.  Data gathered from monitoring the patterns of crop damage and pest movement can be used to teach machine learning programs to predict when and where the pests will strike next, pre-warning farmers and giving fair warning to allow counter measures to be put in place before it's too late.

### Weather and Climate Forecasts
>![Weather Forecast](/images/weather-forecast.png)
The great uncertainty of weather can be reduced, with micro climate models emerging to offer predictions relevant to individual farms - or even fields.  Historic trends, combined with regional factors and forecasts, can be used to train weather models that offer actionable insights.

### Demand Prediction

The greater the foresight to predict which produce will be wanted, the greater the ability to meet that demand, and to reduce waste growth of unwanted crops.  Fashions are fickle, but the slightest of trends can be inferred by observing and ingesting inhuman numbers of factors and forecasts of growth and decline in specific purchasing habits could be utilised to permit effective advance planning.

### Business as Usual
Problems common to every business plague agriculture just as much as they do every other industry.  

- Proactive equipment maintenance can not only reduce the instance of substantial repair bills, but also allow downtime to be scheduled.  Statistical computer models can be used to seek out hidden and subtle anomalies in operating characteristics of machinery and highlight correlations of unusual sensor readings with specific mechanical faults.
- Volatility in suppliers can be predicted by the application of time series modelling, accounting for natural variability in trends, seasonal variation and other factors which may influence the reliability of a supplier.
- Many parameters of strategic planning and effective decision making can be made more accurately and consistently with regression analysis and binary outcome prediction engines.  Fully automated machine learning (Auto-ML) will ingest your data, continuously learning from past actions and outcomes and improving over time.  As the market and operating conditions change, Auto-ML will recognise and adapt, ensuring your solution does not drift out of line and become stale.

[How a Japanese Cucumber Farmer is Using Deep Learning and TensorFlow](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/how-a-japanese-cucumber-farmer-is-using-deep-learning-and-tensorflow){:target="_blank"} - AI is sorting cucumbers by size, shape, colour and other attributes on a scale that works for small growers and large mono-crop estates.

[The Flourish Project is using robotics to deliver precision farming](http://flourish-project.eu/){:target="_blank"} - To feed a growing world population with the given amount of arable land, we must develop new methods of sustainable farming that increase yield while minimizing chemical inputs such as fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides. Precision agricultural techniques seek to address this challenge by monitoring key indicators of crop health and targeting treatment only to plants or infested areas that need it.
