### [According to Sci NC](http://science.unctv.org/content/reportersblog/choices){:target="_blank"} we  each typically make 35,000 decisions every day, and we don't always choose well. <


Our choice-making strategy is complex, working in factors including impulse, pleasing others, delegation, prioritisation and, of course, reasoning.  And there are pressures which may lead to compromised judgements.

- Time
- Decision fatigue
- Distraction
- Logical complexity
- Lack of input
- Multitasking
- Emotion or state of mind
- Availability of experts

Automated decision making can take on some of the burden of decision-making, with great aplomb for tasks which are highly repetitive, such as checking thousands of transactions for money laundering; for decisions which require significant analysis, like creating models for bespoke pricing; and for operations where the consequences of being as right as possible can be significant, including demand forecasting.
