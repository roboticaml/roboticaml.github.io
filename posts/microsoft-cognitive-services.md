- Scene and activity recognition in images
- Celebrity and landmark recognition in images
- Optical character recognition (OCR) in images
- Handwriting recognition 
- Face detection in images 
- Person identification in images 
- Emotion recognition in images 
- Similar face recognition and grouping in image
- Explicit or offensive content moderation for images and videos 
- Custom image and text lists to block or allow matching content 
- Tools for including feedback from human moderators

- Customisable speech recognition and speech transcription (speech-to-text) 
- Customisable speech models for unique vocabularies or accents
- Automatic text-to-speech
- Customisable voice fonts for text-to-speech
- Speaker identification 
- Speaker verification
- Real-time translation 


## Knowledge 
Map complex information and data in order to solve tasks such as intelligent recommendations and semantic search.  Leverage or create rich knowledge resources that can be integrated into apps and services with Knowledge services.
- QnA extraction from unstructured text
- Knowledge base creation from collections of Q&As 
- Semantic matching for knowledge bases 


## Search 
Add Bing Search APIs to your apps and harness the ability to comb billions of web pages, images, videos and news with a single API call.  Enable apps and services to harness the power of a web-scale, ad-free search engine with Search.
