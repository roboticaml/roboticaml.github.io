Corporate technology research leader [Forrester](https://go.forrester.com/){:target="_blank"}  has released their report on how DataRobot unlocks business value in the enterprise.  The DataRobot artificial intelligence (AI) platform brings new machine learning capabilities and extends existing data science programmes across the entire data lifecycle.  Forrester examined Total Economic Impact (TEI) and Return on Investment (ROI) and found that investments in DataRobot, which is available from around Â£40,000, improved product demand, lowered costs and reduced the need to hire large data science teams.
