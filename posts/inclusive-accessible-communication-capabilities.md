# Inclusive, Accessible Communication Capabilities

## Towards Deaf Equity with British Sign Language

Written words are not enough: many d/Deaf people rely on British Sign Language and have limited or even no access to reading.

They say that all anger stems from surprise.  And find out about developments only after the consultation period is certain to fuel complaints from residents.  Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?

Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, enabling them to partake in the planning process during the consultation period.

Robotica will help you by translating your information into British Sign Language, so that your departmental communications become inclusive, and contribute towards compliance with accessibility laws, whilst demonstrating your commitment to serving diverse audiences.

* There are more than 300 sign languages in use around the world.  These are used by over 70 million deaf people globally.
* Sign language families do not necessarily follow spoken language families. For instance, American Sign Language (ASL) is a close relative of French Sign Language (La Langue des Signes Française or LSF), but largely unrelated to British Sign Language (BSL). French and American sign language users are more likely to understand each other than people trying to converse between ASL and BSL.
* As many as 80,000 people in the United Kingdom depend on BSL as their first, or their only language.
* When people are presented with information in English, but the need BSL, they may be left uninformed, unconsenting, and under-served.
* Deaf school-leavers may have an average reading age of between 6 and 8 years.  There is no correlation between hearing loss and intelligence, but the disadvantage of learning to read without phonics support often puts d/Deaf children at a disadvantage that can follow them throughout life.
