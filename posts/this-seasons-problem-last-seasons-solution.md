## This season's problem, last seasons solution?
This season's problems aren't best solved with last season's solutions, but that is exactly how many software and AI vendors expect you to operate.  They either "hard code" intricate rules, based on their observations, or they put in place machine learning that can retrain, but depends on essentially the same inputs and outcomes.  Are they seeing "hope things don't change" as a viable strategy, or are they cynically building in obsolescence?

Only with a machine learning solution, designed to constantly evolve, can you stay current and always be armed with the best solution.

## The only constant is change
Whatever problem you are addressing, you can be sure that the solution won't be appropriate forever.  Whether changes come suddenly, or whether they accumulate gradually over time, the outcome is the same.  You need a new solution.

Machine learning is a type of software solution that learns by reading historic events, looking for patterns and generating a model to incorporate those patterns into predictions.  This type of AI is often much more capable than hand crafted code by programmers, or indeed any humans, could craft because the patterns are usually very subtle, intricate and indistinct. 

### Data drift
Some of the better machine learning solutions continue to learn after the model is created, seeking to nudge or adjust the model to fit with minor shifts in trends.  As long as the model is still fundamentally sound, drifting data is addressed by remodelling.

### Model drift
Should data drift too far, or should an unusual event such as a new competitor change the landscape, the original model may no longer be capable of offering a credible solution.

Robotica Machine Learning solutions go far beyond remodelling.  They constantly revisit every data science decision, trying out different modelling approaches and algorithms to see if there is a better, more accurate, more efficient, more effective solution possible.  Solutions evolve over time, ensuring you always have the best AI for your problems.

## Black box solutions don't fit all processes
A solution that works might not be enough.  You have governance rules, auditing, regulations and other compliance considerations.  

Legal, financial, strategic and ethical considerations has in the past prohibited machine learning from being viable.  Robotica Machine Learning recognises this reality and addresses these very real concerns.
