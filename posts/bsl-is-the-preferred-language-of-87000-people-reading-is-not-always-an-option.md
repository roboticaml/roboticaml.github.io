## Reading is not always an option

Some d/Deaf people may struggle with reading and writing.  Many d/Deaf individuals, particularly those who use British Sign Language (BSL), have difficulty with written text because it's a different language from BSL. They lack exposure to spoken English due to their hearing impairment, making basics like phonetics hard to learn. Unlike those with full hearing, they can't rely on sound-based methods for reading and writing. Additionally, signed languages have distinct grammar and sentence structures, further complicating translation between sign language and written/spoken languages.
