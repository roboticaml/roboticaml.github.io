introtext: Sign language (not reading) may be your only option

**Reading is not always an option**

Some d/Deaf people may struggle with reading and writing.  Many d/Deaf individuals, particularly those who use British Sign Language (BSL), have difficulty with written text because it's a different language from BSL. They lack exposure to spoken English due to their hearing impairment, making basics like phonetics hard to learn. Unlike those with full hearing, they can't rely on sound-based methods for reading and writing. Additionally, signed languages have distinct grammar and sentence structures, further complicating translation between sign language and written/spoken languages.

**Are you excluding 150,000 people in the UK?**

Even for those d/Deaf people who have no trouble reading English, if BSL is their first langauge it makes sense to offer information and services in their preferred language.  Video translations into sign languages can help your customers to feel included.
