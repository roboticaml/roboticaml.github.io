>Big data and machine learning projects are, unsurprisingly, a huge growth area in many organisations. The benefits on offer, in terms of increased margins, lower costs, greater reliability and the opening of new opportunities cannot be ignored. Your business may have grown from judgement-based to evidence-based decisions and quite recently taken the step into leading through predictive models. The next stage of the journey is automated machine learning, expediting the journey from business objective to active solution and providing a platform to scale. Automating some or all of your machine learning pipeline will help you to concentrate your data science resources on their highest-value tasks in a virtuous circle of competitive advantage.

Provisioning these tools is a challenge for organisations and departments operating on a limited budget, and implementing them is often a hassle. Although they can acquire conventional machine learning tools from external vendors, they have to contend with the cost of software installation and maintenance, including the time and effort it takes the internal IT team to provide support for the extensive changes that traditional machine learning initiatives require.
