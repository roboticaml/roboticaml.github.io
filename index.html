  <h2>DataRobot</h2>
  <div>
  <p>DataRobot is a machine learning platform for automating, assuring, and accelerating predictive analytics, helping data scientists and analysts build and deploy accurate predictive models in a fraction of the time required by other solutions and is at the heart of most Allied Machine Learning integrations. </p>

  <p>For seasoned data scientists, DataRobot provides a growing library of the latest algorithms and pre-built prototypes for feature extraction and data preparation. It also provides automated ensembling, allowing them to easily select and combine multiple algorithms to rapidly produce more accurate predictive models. </p>
  <p>For new data scientists, DataRobot assures best data science practices by automating the selection of the best features, algorithms, and parameter values for building each model, and so eliminating the need for trial-and-error guesswork.</p>
  
  <p>For business data analysts, DataRobot enables and guides a rapid transition from reporting to prediction, empowering them to perform modelling tasks that previously always required highly skilled data scientists and statisticians.</p>
  
  <p>And for the business, DataRobot reduces the risk, cost, and time to value in the adoption and expansion of predictive analytics for faster, better decisions. It does this by making machine learning simpler and faster, and by optimising scarce and costly data science skills.</p>
