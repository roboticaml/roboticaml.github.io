Cookie policy:
We respect you. The App does not send cookies to websites or webservices operated by Cued Speech UK or Robotica Machine Learning.  We do exchange and store a Player Identity when you use a uCue QR barcode to login to the game and subsequently to record your progress through the game.  If you use the Facebook feature, we receive from Facebook a token which is unique to you which we use when you ask for your game progress to be posted to your Facebook account.  We may share selected information with Facebook, on your instruction but we will ask you first and only proceed with your explicit consent.
