# Driving Valuable Business Insights with DataRobot

![LogMeIn](/img/clients/logmein.png)

One of the world’s leading SaaS companies uses automated machine learning to answer questions in minutes that would otherwise take days or weeks.

## The Situation 
LogMeIn, a cloud connectivity company whose mission is to simplify the way people interact with each other and the world around them, has grown to become one of the world’s leading SaaS companies by focusing on, and disrupting, some of today's most transformative technology markets, including collaboration, identity, and customer engagement and support. Its strategy is to provide valuable, intuitive, and innovative products to customers, continuously evaluating how data science can be applied to execute on that strategy.


Greenhut and his colleagues think about applying data science to answer questions like: 
- How can we convert more users to customers or increase customer engagement? 
- How can we understand new opportunities from customer feedback? 
- How can we make our onboarding processes more intuitive? How can we improve our products by understanding the way customers use them? 

> “Machine learning is beautiful in a mathematical way. Now that our world collects so much data, we can apply data science to so many different questions.” 
– Andrew Greenhut senior data scientist


The opportunity was ripe for data science to impact LogMeIn’s analytics efforts, but its processes were prohibitive. Data scientists had been manually building predictive models in siloed environments. The process involved constantly recreating and transforming code, which was tedious, repetitive, and inefﬁcient. This workﬂow was not conducive to solving problems that require fast, iterative model development and the ability to derive actionable insights from predictive analytics.


## The Solution 
Upon engaging with DataRobot, LogMeIn immediately appreciated its value. “DataRobot does something different from other tools,” said Greenhut. “It offers a high-quality auto-modeling tool that creates amazing models with ﬁne-tuned adjustments in a matter of minutes, and not only that, it offers really high quality model evaluation tools that can be used to understand which models are the best.” Today, DataRobot provides a rapid prototyping environment to LogMeIn through Amazon Web Services (AWS), allowing users to identify signals across a variety of data sets, such as Net Promoter Scores (NPS), customer engagement, product usage, user onboarding, and trial activity.

> “When we’re able to get rid of the repetitive and laborious tasks in a modeling process, we can free our minds to think about more high-level data science questions. We can spend our most productive hours answering the business question rather than trying to remember how to code certain models or researching how to answer certain technical questions.” – Andrew Greenhut senior data scientist


## Results
DataRobot’s built-in automated machine learning capabilities have saved LogMeIn time and money by accelerating model building and deployment cycles across the board and allowing staﬀ to focus on business problems instead of technicalities of the process. Questions that would previously take the team days or weeks to answer can now be addressed in minutes. Once a model is built, LogMeIn uses DataRobot’s powerful APIs to turn models on in production so business value can quickly be measured. DataRobot also makes it easy to add new data sets to existing models so their accuracy is continuously measured and improved.
