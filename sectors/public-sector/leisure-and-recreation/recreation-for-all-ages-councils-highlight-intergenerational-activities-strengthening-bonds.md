## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  Through communication, councils promote intergenerational recreational activities, fostering connections between different age groups and enhancing a sense of unity within the community.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by participating in recreational activities that bring generations together and nurture a strong sense of community.
