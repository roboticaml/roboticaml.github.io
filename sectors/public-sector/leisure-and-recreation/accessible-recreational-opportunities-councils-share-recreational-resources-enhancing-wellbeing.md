## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  Councils provide information on accessible recreational opportunities, ensuring that residents have easy access to activities that contribute to physical and mental well-being.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by participating in a variety of recreational activities that enhance their health and happiness.
