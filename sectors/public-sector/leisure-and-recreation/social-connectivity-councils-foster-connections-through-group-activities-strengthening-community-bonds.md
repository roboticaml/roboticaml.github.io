## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  Through communication, councils promote group leisure activities, encouraging residents to connect with others, build friendships, and strengthen the sense of community.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by participating in group leisure activities that foster meaningful social interactions and friendships.
