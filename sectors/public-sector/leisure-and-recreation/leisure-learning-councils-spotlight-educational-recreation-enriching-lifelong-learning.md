## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  Through communication, councils highlight educational recreational opportunities, inspiring residents to engage in leisure activities that promote continuous learning and personal growth.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by exploring and participating in recreational activities that expand their knowledge and skills.
