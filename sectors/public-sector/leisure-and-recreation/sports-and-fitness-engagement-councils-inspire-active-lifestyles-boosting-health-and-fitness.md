## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  Councils encourage sports and fitness engagement by sharing information about available facilities and programs, motivating residents to prioritize physical well-being through active leisure activities.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by engaging in sports and fitness activities that improve their health and overall fitness levels.
