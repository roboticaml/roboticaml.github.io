## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  Councils showcase cultural and arts events, promoting diversity and encouraging residents to participate in leisure activities that celebrate different cultures and artistic expressions.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by actively engaging in cultural events and exploring diverse forms of artistic expression.
