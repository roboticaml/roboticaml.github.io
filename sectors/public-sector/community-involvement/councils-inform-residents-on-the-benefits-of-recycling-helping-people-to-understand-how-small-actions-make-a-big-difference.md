## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  By providing insights into the positive environmental impact of recycling, councils empower residents to contribute to a sustainable future through their everyday choices.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
