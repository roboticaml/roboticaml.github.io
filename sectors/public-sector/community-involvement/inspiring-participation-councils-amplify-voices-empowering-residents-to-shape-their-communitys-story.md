## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  Councils amplify resident voices, guiding them to actively contribute ideas and initiatives, enabling residents to play a crucial role in defining their community's narrative.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by sharing their ideas and visions for community growth and development.
