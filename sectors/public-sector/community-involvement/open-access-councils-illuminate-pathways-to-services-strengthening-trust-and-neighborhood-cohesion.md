## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  Through transparent communication, councils build trust by ensuring residents are well-informed about available services, leading to a stronger and more connected community.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by accessing essential services with confidence and trust.
