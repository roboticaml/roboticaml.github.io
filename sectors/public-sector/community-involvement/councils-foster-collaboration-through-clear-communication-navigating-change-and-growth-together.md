## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  By maintaining open lines of communication, councils and residents collaboratively adapt to change, fostering a united community that thrives on shared visions.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by actively participating in community dialogues and initiatives.
