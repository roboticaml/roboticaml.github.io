# Harnessing Unity: Councils Fuel Collaborative Community Growth Through Clear Communication Channels

![]()

## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  By promoting open and clear communication, councils encourage residents to work collaboratively, fostering a spirit of unity and shared progress within the community.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by joining hands to collectively shape a thriving community for all.
