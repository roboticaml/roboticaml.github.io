# Business Access Insights: Councils Ensure Access to Local Shops, Boosting Commerce

## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  Councils provide information on maintaining access to local businesses during roadworks, supporting economic activity and encouraging residents to continue supporting local commerce.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by actively visiting and supporting local businesses even during roadwork periods.
