## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  By providing updates on roadworks and traffic disruptions, councils help residents plan their commutes more efficiently, reducing travel stress and saving valuable time.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by staying informed about roadworks and making informed travel decisions for a smoother commute.
