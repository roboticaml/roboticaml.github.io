# Safer Roads Ahead: Councils Share Roadwork Details, Enhancing Driver Awareness

![]()

## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  Councils share detailed information about ongoing roadworks, enabling drivers to navigate construction zones safely and responsibly, thus reducing the risk of accidents.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by adhering to safety guidelines and practicing cautious driving when encountering roadworks and construction areas.
