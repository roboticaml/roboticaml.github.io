## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  By sharing information about cyclist-friendly routes and temporary bike paths during roadworks, councils promote cycling as a sustainable and efficient mode of transport.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by utilizing temporary bike paths and following cyclist-friendly routes during roadwork periods.
