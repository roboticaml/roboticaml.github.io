## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  Councils provide educational resources on healthy eating, empowering residents to make informed dietary choices that contribute to better nutrition and overall health.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by making conscious decisions about their diet and consuming balanced and nutritious meals.
