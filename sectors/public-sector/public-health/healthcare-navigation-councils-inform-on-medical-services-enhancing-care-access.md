# Healthcare Navigation: Councils Inform on Medical Services, Enhancing Care Access

![]()

## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  By providing information on medical services and care options, councils enable residents to navigate healthcare resources and access the appropriate care for their health needs.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by seeking appropriate medical care and accessing healthcare services that address their health concerns.
