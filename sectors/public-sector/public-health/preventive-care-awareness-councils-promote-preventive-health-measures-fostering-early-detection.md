## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  Councils promote awareness of preventive health measures, encouraging residents to take proactive steps in monitoring their health and seeking timely medical attention when needed.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by actively engaging in regular health screenings and check-ups for early detection and prevention.
