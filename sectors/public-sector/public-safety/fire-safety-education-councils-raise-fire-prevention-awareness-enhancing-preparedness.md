## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  Councils raise awareness about fire safety and prevention, equipping residents with the knowledge to prevent fires and respond effectively in case of a fire emergency.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by implementing fire safety practices, conducting fire drills, and ensuring a safe living environment.
