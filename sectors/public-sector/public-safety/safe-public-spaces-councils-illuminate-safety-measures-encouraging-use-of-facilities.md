## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  Councils highlight safety measures in public spaces, reassuring residents about the security of recreational areas and encouraging active utilization of community facilities.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by enjoying public spaces, facilities, and amenities while feeling safe and secure in their community environment.
