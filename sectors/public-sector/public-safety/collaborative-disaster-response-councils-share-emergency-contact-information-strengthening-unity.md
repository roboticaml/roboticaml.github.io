# Collaborative Disaster Response: Councils Share Emergency Contact Information, Strengthening Unity

![]()

## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  Through communication, councils share emergency contact information and resources, fostering a sense of unity and collaborative disaster response among residents.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by staying informed about emergency contacts, resources, and protocols, and coming together in times of crisis.
