## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  Through communication, councils promote recycling efforts that reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills, contributing to a more sustainable waste management system and a healthier environment.
