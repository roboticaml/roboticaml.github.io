## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Residents need to know about changes to their bin collection services, but unless the communications are made accessible, some people will be denied their rights and feel excluded.  Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?

Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, enabling them to partake in the planning process during the consultation period.
