## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  Councils highlight the benefits of waste reduction and resource conservation, inspiring residents to reduce their waste generation and make more sustainable consumption choices.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by adopting a waste-conscious lifestyle and making eco-friendly choices that contribute to resource conservation.
