## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  Through communication, councils clarify how tax revenue supports essential local services, ensuring residents understand the importance of their tax payments in maintaining community well-being.

Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by recognizing the value of their tax payments in sustaining vital local services and actively contributing to a well-functioning community.
