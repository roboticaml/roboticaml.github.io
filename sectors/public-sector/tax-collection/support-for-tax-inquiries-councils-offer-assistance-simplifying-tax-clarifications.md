## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  Councils provide support for tax-related inquiries and clarifications, ensuring that residents have the information they need to understand their tax obligations.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by seeking assistance and getting accurate information to clarify any questions about their taxes.
