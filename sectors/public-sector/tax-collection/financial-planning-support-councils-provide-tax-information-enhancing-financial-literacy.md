## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  By providing tax information and resources, councils empower residents to make informed financial decisions, improving their financial literacy and overall money management skills.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by using tax information to make well-informed financial choices that support their financial goals.
