## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  Through communication, councils highlight available community support resources related to housing, ensuring that residents have access to essential services that contribute to their overall well-being.
