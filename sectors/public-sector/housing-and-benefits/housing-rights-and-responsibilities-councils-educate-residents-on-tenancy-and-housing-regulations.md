## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  By offering information on housing rights and responsibilities, councils empower residents to understand and assert their rights as tenants, leading to fair and respectful housing interactions.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by actively advocating for their housing rights and responsibilities and creating positive living environments.
