## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  By sharing sustainable development plans, councils encourage residents to participate in community growth initiatives that enhance the local environment and quality of life.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
