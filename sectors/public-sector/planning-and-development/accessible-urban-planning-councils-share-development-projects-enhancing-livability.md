## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  Through communication, councils provide insights into urban planning and development projects, empowering residents to understand how changes positively impact their urban environment and daily lives.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by participating in discussions and activities that promote accessible and livable urban spaces.
