## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  Through communication, councils create opportunities for open dialogue on planning and development, ensuring that residents have a voice in shaping the future of their community.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by actively participating in discussions and decision-making processes that shape the development of their community.
