## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  By raising awareness about local biodiversity, councils encourage residents to appreciate and protect the natural ecosystems in their community, preserving the beauty and balance of the environment.
