## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  By offering environmental education programs, councils promote a culture of lifelong learning, enabling residents of all ages to understand and appreciate the importance of environmental stewardship.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by actively engaging in environmental education opportunities and sharing their knowledge with others.
