## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  Through adult education initiatives, councils promote continuous learning and skill development, enabling residents to thrive in their personal and professional lives.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by enrolling in adult education programs and expanding their skill sets.
