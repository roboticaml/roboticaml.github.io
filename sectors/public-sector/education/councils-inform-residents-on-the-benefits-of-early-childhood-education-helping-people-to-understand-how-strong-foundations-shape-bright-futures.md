## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  By sharing insights into the importance of early childhood education, councils empower parents to make informed decisions about their children's education journey.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by enrolling their children in quality early childhood education programs.
