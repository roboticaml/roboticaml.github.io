## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  By showcasing the impact of voting on community development, councils encourage residents to take pride in their civic responsibility and actively participate in elections.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by voting in elections and contributing to positive changes in their community.
