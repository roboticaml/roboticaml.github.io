## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  Councils shine a light on citizen-led initiatives that advocate for change, inspiring residents to take action and play a role in shaping their local policies and governance.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by joining local advocacy efforts and actively participating in community-driven initiatives.
