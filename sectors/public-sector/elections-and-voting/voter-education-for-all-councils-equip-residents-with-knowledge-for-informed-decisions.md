## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  By providing voter education resources, councils empower residents with the information needed to make informed choices during elections, enhancing the quality of democratic engagement.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by staying informed about candidates and issues and making informed choices at the polls.
