# Accessible Voter Information: Councils Foster Inclusivity in Elections, Ensuring Every Voice is Heard

![]()

## Ensuring Accessibility Compliance with AI Sign Language Translation

Local authorities' careful communication, using accessible fonts and colours, means that messaging reaches most people.  Through accessible voter information, councils create an environment where all residents, including those with disabilities, have the resources needed to engage in the electoral process.  
But did you know that a lot of Deaf people struggle to read English and rely entire on British Sign Language?
Something as simple as a QR code can help Deaf residents have access to the same information as everyone else, helping by exercising their right to vote and voicing their opinions in elections.
