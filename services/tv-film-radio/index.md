## Digital Human Sign Language Translation
We offer accurate broadcast-quality, in-vision Sign Language translation for pre-recorded video content. Digital Human Interpreters extend the capability of signed programming beyond documentaries and news into premium dramas, movies, and even radio.

Extend the reach of your content â€“ content that would not be feasible to offer in British Sign Language using traditional methods.

## Digital Human Cued Speech Transliteration

We provide accurate broadcast-quality in-vision cued speech transliteration services for television, film, DVDs, Corporate media, training and educational materials, conference calls and websites, for live and pre-recorded video content.

Our cued speech transliteration service is powered by our AVComprehend platform and our Cassie virtual transliterator.

On-demand Cued Speech cueing, captioning and lip-speaking provides instant transliterations, offering Deaf accessibility for live and pre-recorded programming.

## Accessible Radio

We can make radio accessible for deaf people through Cassie.

We provide live Cued Speech transliteration driven from either captions or from an audio feed.

We provide Sign-Language interpretation for pre-recorded radio shows. This can either be for recorded shows as they are broadcast, or a Sign Language interpretation of a previously-live show on a catch-up service.
